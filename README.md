Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  `npm start`
    Starts the development server.

  `npm run build`
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  `npm test`
    Starts the test runner.

  `npm run eject`
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

```sh
  cd my-app
  npm start
```
